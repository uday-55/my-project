Build a complete web-based prototype for the AI-Enabled Value Chain Platform for Oilseed Self-Reliance (PS 25270) using Flask (Python) as the backend and HTML + CSS + JavaScript for the frontend.

🌾 Overview

India still imports 55–60% of its edible oil despite a major rise in oilseed production. The goal is to create a single integrated AI + Blockchain + Analytics platform connecting all key stakeholders — farmers, FPOs/processors, retailers, and policymakers — to optimize the oilseed value chain from seed to shelf.

🏗️ Key Functional Modules
👨‍🌾 Farmer Dashboard

Crop selection (soybean, groundnut, mustard, sunflower)

AI-powered price prediction using mock ML logic (simulate real forecasting)

Crop advisory card showing:

Weather alerts

Pest risk warning

Recommended sowing & harvest time

Input: harvest quantity (kg or tonnes)

Button: “Sell Crop” → adds a Blockchain transaction entry

Credit & insurance recommendation module (based on performance or data)

🏭 FPO/Processor Dashboard

View blockchain transaction list (farmer sales)

Manage procurement & inventory

Display simple Chart.js visualizations:

Crops purchased by type

Warehouse capacity utilization

Option to generate or simulate “forward contract” with farmers

🧑‍💼 Policymaker/Admin Dashboard

View national summary analytics:

Total transactions

Total oilseed volume handled

Price trends & predicted future price (mock chart)

Interactive AI insights panel (AI-generated suggestions)

Logistics & warehouse map visualization (simulated)

Integration placeholder: “Connected to AgriStack API”

🧠 AI Module (Simulated)

Function that uses mock logic or random generation to predict oilseed prices for the next 7 days.

Use matplotlib or Chart.js for visualizing the predicted trend line.

Display “AI Insight Cards” summarizing key analytics like:

“Mustard oil price expected to rise by 5% next week”

“Soybean output expected to drop due to monsoon delay”

🔗 Blockchain Simulation

Create a simple blockchain model in Python:

Each block = farmer name, crop, price, quantity, timestamp, and hash.

Store blocks in a local Python list (blockchain = []).

Display all transactions on the FPO & Admin dashboards.

Add function to verify the chain’s integrity.

📊 Data Visualization

Use Chart.js or Plotly.js for:

Crop price trend chart (AI prediction)

Warehouse utilization pie chart

Volume traded line graph

Add simple mock datasets to demonstrate analytics.

🎨 Frontend / UI Design

Use a nature-themed modern UI (green, white, light brown palette).

Responsive layout (works on mobile & desktop).

Include:

Navigation bar for roles (Home | Farmer | FPO | Admin)

Dashboard cards with shadow & rounded corners

Beautiful gradients and icons for visual appeal

Optional: Add a small animation when AI results or blockchain updates are shown.

⚙️ Backend Structure (Flask)

Flask routes:

/ → Homepage with role selection

/farmer → Farmer dashboard

/fpo → FPO dashboard

/admin → Policymaker dashboard

Store data in dictionaries or JSON (no database needed)

Separate logic into functions: predict_price(), add_block(), get_summary()
