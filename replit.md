  - Enhanced popups with location details, icons, and formatted info
  - Marker drop animations on load
  - Continuous pulse animations for visibility
  - Hover effects with scale transformation
- Responsive design matching dashboard theme
- Centered on India (lat: 20.5937, lng: 78.9629) with pan and zoom capabilities
- Map controls: zoom buttons, scroll wheel zoom, double-click zoom, touch zoom
